* Overview
Griffin is a distributed named task execution framework. Simply put, if you associate a method in a class to a string, you can treat the pair like a HashMap. Add in networking to the mix, and now you can control your phone from your desktop, your raspberry pi from your phone, and so on. So, you take a block of execution, and name it then give the ability to execute that block by calling its name to another computer.

* Installation
    1. Download the jars, apks, and ini files from [[https://github.com/zZelman/Griffin/releasse][releases]]
    2. Eddit the information within =server_list.ini=
         - The =[nameserver]= entry's =hostname= needs to be accessible from everywhere
         - Do not edit the =hostname= for =[localhost]=
         - You may change anything within the other blocks
    3. Install the apk onto your android device with =adb install app.apk=

* Usage
    1. Start the nameserver
         - Open a terminal and run =java -jar nameserver.jar=
    2. Start the servers
         - Open another terminal and run =java -jar daemon.jar=
         - Open the app on your phone and press the button labeled =Start=
    3. Using the clients
         - Open another terminal and run =java -jar cli.jar [target] [command...]= (there is a  =help= on each server)
         - In the app there is a command field enter =[target] [command...]=

*Client argument explanation*
    - *target* is the name of the heading in =server_list.ini= ie =desktop= from =[desktop]=
    - *command* is the name of the block of execution you want to run on the target (there is a

* How to stop a server
    - There is a task named =stop server= on each server. However, this must be the *only* string sent to the server.
    - You can press a button labeled =Stop= on the android app

* Examples
    - =desktop help=
    - =desktop shell ls=
    - =desktop shell pwd=
    - =android help=
    - =localhost help=
    - =desktop stop server=
    - =localhost stop server=

* TODO
    - [ ] Change the networking model from using Java's Serializable interface to buffer oriented
    - [ ] Add more tasks
